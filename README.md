# St.Benedict
The translation of the book of St. Benedict, written by Saint Gregory the Great, (Dialogues)

## about the book

This book is translated from italian version which is translated from latin version.
Since I'm not native speaker, some words could sounds really odd to native speakers.
So if you want to correct some phrases, you are welcome.

The idea is to stay sticky to italian version, so your corrections shouldn't so far from original version.
